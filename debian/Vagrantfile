-------------------------------------------
perfSONAR Debian build machine is ready!
You can use it with the following commands:

vagrant ssh
./ps-cowbuilder-build $PS_REPO
-------------------------------------------

The resulting packages will be in a directory called /result/
at the same level as this git repository.
